# Schemas

Value in ad-hoc schema concensus, rather than a-priori agreement. Consensus via practice. Schemas are fluid, changing. 



## Types as first step
- Start with describing your data as is best for your data
- If needed, find ways to adopt common practices

## Re-using types
- With a rich ecosystem of types, you can hopefully reduce the energy put into schema design. Take some best practices, add your glue, and go.
- Allows easier inter-oparability with common datasets.

- Many collections are used simply to define schemas, provide examples, and be a common point for a community
