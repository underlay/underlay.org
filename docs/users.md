# User Profiles

Each user account has a basic user profile. The profile is accessible at `underlay.org/${namespace}`. The user profile will show:
- The list of all collections within that user's namespace
- A list of communities that user belongs to
- Links to the user's other presences on the internet
- A short 'about' blurb

A user can edit their account and profile settings from this space as well. `underlay.org/${userNamespace}/settings`.

## Future features
We intend to build richer features into the user profile allowing them to display their contributions and activity across different collections. A user should be able to collect and present their discussions, data contributions, and other activity as a means of demonstrating their experience and involvement in various projects and communities.
