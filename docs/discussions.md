# Discussions

Underlay.org provides an interface for adding discussions to a collection. These discussions can either be scoped to the collection as a whole, or they can reference a specific piece of data. 

Discussions are implemented by automatically adding a `Discussion` type to the collection's schema. Discussions thus are integrated into the data of the collection, rather than existing at a platform-level separate from the collection data. Exporting a collection will bring with it all the discussions and their connections.
