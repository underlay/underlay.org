# Underlay Docs

Underlay ([underlay.org](https://www.underlay.org)) is a project of the Knowledge Futures Group.

These documents serve to give an overview of the project, how it can be used, and our vision for building it further. 

It seeks to fulfill a very simply value proposition of making data more used. 

This will also make private data more useful and give it a pathway to being used by broader audiences.

More on Value prop

The project is focused on the social elements of making data sharable. We're not talking about the most cutting-edge, futuristic, data-magic - but rather building systems with a focus on sound, simple technical foundation and the social design that allows them to be used by many.
