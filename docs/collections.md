# Collections

- Basic element in Underlay and any future protocols.
- A collection is schema + data
- It should be portable
- It should contain everything about itself (or reference to other collections that contain that)
  - e.g. Discussions are not a platform-layer feature, but a data type that is stored in the colleciton itself.

- Have a canonical slug, and then a readable slug. 
- Canonical slug is persistent across namespace merges and renames.
