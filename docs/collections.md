# Collections

- Basic element in Underlay and any future protocols.
- A collection is schema + data
- It should be portable
- It should contain everything about itself (or reference to other collections that contain that)
  - e.g. Discussions are not a platform-layer feature, but a data type that is stored in the colleciton itself.

- Have a canonical slug, and then a readable slug. 
- Canonical slug is persistent across namespace merges and renames.


# Where does the Underlay get its data?
The Underlay draws its content from public information sources, including public records, scientific publications, commercial catalogs, the web, and open databases created for the public good. The Underlay also provides a convenient way for for-profit, not-for-profit, and government organizations to publish machine-readable information that they wish to make easily available, including schedules, catalogs, scientific datasets, public disclosures, standards, and more.
