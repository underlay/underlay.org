# Alpha Testing

We are rolling out an initial version of Underlay dubbed `build-target-1`. This build target focuses on providing enough structure to have a discussion around three topics:

1. The definition and use of shared schemas
   - shared types?
   - 
2. The workflow and interfaces for adding data
   - Forms, web UI, API, collection transform
   - Collection transforms can be from another collection, or yourself
3. The interfaces for using data stored in different collections How do you want to use data?
   - API, exports, queries, etc


## 1. Shared schemas

## 2. Data workflows

## 3. Data usage
