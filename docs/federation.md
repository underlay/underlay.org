# Federation

Much thought has been given to what systems should exist as such.

There is a tension between moving quickly in early stage development, and eventual autonomy and power dynamic necessary. 

We do not advocate for trustless systems, as we don't believe such things are possible once you reach the realm of social structures and culture. 

We do believe in trusted institutions playing an important role, and our eventual vision is towards one of federation. 

Our initial ask is not to host a node though, but to help us iterate on the core offering. We're throwing one party to start, and once we know *how* to throw that party and what's included in it, we intend to have multiple parties facilitated by a common protocol and set of expectations.
