# Communities

Users can create communities which will have a dedicated namespace and profile. This profile is accessible at `underlay.org/${namespace}`. Communities are analogous to an Organization or Team feature that you may find on other platforms. Communities are a good tool for companies, institutions, collective efforts, and other organizations to maintain a presence and shared identity on Underlay. Communities can have members and maintain collections that are commonly maintained based on the permission settings of the community. 

A community profile will show:

- The list of all collections within that community's namespace
- A list of members that belong to the community
- Links to the community's other presences on the internet
- A short 'about' blurb

User's with sufficient permissions can edit the community account and profile settings from this space as well. `underlay.org/${namespace}/settings`.
