The Underlay works by allowing anyone to make assertions about the world, including false ones. Critically, the Underlay provides a method for identifying the source, or provenance, of these assertions. Unlike the explicit existence of a data file, knowledge is nuanced, dynamic, and open to qualitative judgment. As such, the Underlay is designed as much around keeping track of who asserted a particular bit of knowledge as it is the knowledge itself.

Knowledge in the Underlay is not assumed to be true because it has been asserted, but rather, is designed to be curated by an external group of humans or algorithms that organize assertions into a trustworthy set (for any relevant definition of trustworthy). When querying data or building applications, users of the Underlay are able to see exactly who asserted the information theyâ€™re relying on, and how many other people agree with those assertions, allowing them to make informed judgements about the quality and veracity of the data they encounter and use.
